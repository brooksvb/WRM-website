<!-- The above line is declaring to the browser that this text is HTML. -->
<!-- This HTML document is to be well commented so future Webmasters will be able to
understand the document.

First and foremost, HTML is NOT a coding language. It is "Hyper Text Markup Language".
All this means is HTML tells the browser how to display text and other things
on your screen. JavaScript IS a coding language, that can be used alongside HTML;
however, there should be no need for that on this website.

This website was rebuilt by Brooks Van Buren in Spring 2016. It is built using
Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com). Bootstrap is just a library of styles and JavaScript
(don't worry, you don't have to do any coding) that makes building nice looking
websites super quick and easy. I recommend you read the reference document I
created before messing with the HTML.

If you add anything to the website, you must comment it clearly and descriptively
so that future Webmasters and understand it and change it if necessary.

If you ever need advice, help, or can't understand something written in the
HTML, you can email me at wvanbure@purdue.edu. -->

        The goal of the Water Resource Management EPICS team at Purdue is to optimize water
