Rebuilt website for Purdue Engineering Projects in Community Service team Water Resource Management

This is a repo of the rebuilt website for the Water Resource Management team of Engineering Projects in Community Service at Purdue.

I had three objectives in rebuilding this website:
1. Practice newly learned HTML and Bootstrap skills
2. Improve the poor design and coding of the old website
3. Make the website more useful and educational for future webmasters maintaining it

To achieve this, I rebuilt the website from scratch, but maintained the basic layout of the website. In addition to this, I made a new Webmaster Guide in a Word document outlining some basic information and resources useful for learning the skills needed to maintain the website. The logo was also designed by myself.

You can see the website [here.](https://woofiewilly.github.io/WRM-website/)

## EDIT
The team is no longer active at Purdue, and the website is no longer live.

Included is a folder containing the old website for comparison. You can see all the changes I made, while still keeping the same theme intact.
