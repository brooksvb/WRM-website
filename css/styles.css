/* When using css, you have a "selector", which tells the browser what kinds of
elements to apply styles to. Inside the brackets, you have a "attribute", and a
respective "value" for each attribute. A attribute may have multiple values,
separated by spaces, but it must always end with a semicolon.

ex. <attribute-name>: value1 value2;

The colon separates the attribute from its values. */
